<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Zachary, I am 21, I have lived in Western Sydney, Australia my whole life. I enjoy music, cars, travelling and fitness. I have been engaged since last November. Besides learning about IT in high school, my education currently extends to a Certificate IV in Programming and a Diploma of Software Development. I only speak English, though I have previously attempted at learning other languages. Some fun facts about me: I have a twin sister and my best friends are twin brothers. I lost 20kg of fat between late 2019 to mid 2020 which I am very proud of. A fun fact about my family history is that my great grandfather was the third person in the world to fly a small aeroplane from New Zealand to Australia. </p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I am interested in all aspects of IT. I find IT to be a remarkably interesting and diverse topic with so many applications in the world. My primary interest in the IT field would be software development.</p>
<p>My interest in IT started when I was a little kid. One memory I fondly remember is the release of the Lord of the Rings game on the PlayStation2. It was a school holiday and my family had acquired a holiday unit. On the evening of getting the console & game my father and I stayed up until sunrise playing together. I was always a gamer as a kid. I would play daily with my brothers and friends. I have owned multiple consoles and played a plethora of games. I can safely say that gaming has been my biggest influence as my interest in IT. As I aged this then expanded into hardware and building computers, to then software where I was making games and small applications. </p>
<p>I believe my curiosity for software development began when mobile games started to get popular, however my real passion began in year 11 when my Software Design & Development (SDD) teacher inspired the class with his outstanding knowledge. My teacher was the school IT technician and taught one or two classes for the school as per his contract. Our class would make small games in Visual Basic, simple little games but the potential struck me. I really enjoyed coding, I enjoyed seeing my hard work virtually come to life as I could interact with it.</p>
<p>My IT experience extends to my studies. As previously mentioned, I have a Cert IV in Programming and a Diploma of Software Development. Besides a few small attempts at making games on the side my real-life IT experience is not extensive. I have done practical assignments in class where I made small mobile applications that include several features and databases.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to further my studies after my Diploma. I had a few small career changes between then and I was trying to find my path in life. At the beginning of this year, I could see that the career progression I wanted would be easier to obtain with a degree. That is what sparked my main interest to study again, knowing that I could progress further in the company I work for, or follow my dreams of becoming a Software Developer. Either way I was better off by having a degree. I set out searching for a degree that would allow me to work and study, soon enough I stumbled upon OUA and after searching through the offering’s I found this degree at RMIT. I knew after reading it that it was the one. I read a few more to be sure, however they were not as beneficial. I made my decision that day and applied. I really enjoyed the course structure and topics covered in this degree. </p>
<p>I expect to learn about a broad range of topics within the IT Field. I hope to learn more about software engineering and coding. Besides all the theory offered by this degree with its diverse subjects, I hope to learn about real world applications. How to apply myself in the real world by being able to communicate effectively as a team, to learn what is required and to prepare me for a job. </p>

<h1>Ideal job</h1>
<img src="zacgitbot.github.io/job.png" width="400">

<p>https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Stellaris-consulting&t=Ios+Mobile+Developer&jk=545470a25c493981&q=Mobile+Application+Developer&vjs=3 </p>
<p>This job position is for a mobile software developer, specifically to iOS. The company is offering a full-time or contracted position. This job is for all stages of the development cycle. It includes the designing and creating of new applications, as well as the monitoring and running of current applications on the apple store.</p>
<p>This position stood out to me for multiple reasons. To start, the job in question did not ask for any qualifications or degrees, only experience. This suggests to me that this is a good company to work for as they care more about the quality of work and experience of employees as opposed to relying on a degree. Secondly, this is not an isolated role within a company. The job description states that the developer will be implemented throughout all stages of development. This resonated with me as it would give me the creative freedom to design an application that I enjoy. Lastly, the renumeration is extremely lucrative.</p>
<p>This job requires a specific and broad range of skills. These are design skills and experience with multiple programs, serval programming languages relevant to mobile development, a strong programming foundation, professional team development skills relevant to planning and developing, years of experience with iOS development. No degree is listed as a requirement; however, I imagine a programming related degree would be beneficial. </p>
<p>I have a Cert IV in programming and a Diploma of Software Development. My experience currently extends to Android mobile development in Java and Visual Studio. I have a great understanding of the software development life cycle and understand all aspects of the planning, designing, and testing stages. </p>
<p>To obtain the skills required of this job my plan is to commit myself to studying as best as I can. Learning everything possible through my degree and general interest in programming. I have attempted at learning the specified languages previously such as JavaScript and Swift and will continue to learn these through online tutorials, YouTube, and practice. Through applications that I plan to develop I will gain considerable experience and build a fantastic portfolio for myself which will be highly advantageous. I also plan to begin working in the IT/Software Developer industry as soon as possible, to do this I will use my portfolio and humbly accept any internship, job, or freelance work, gaining valuable experience and knowledge whilst I attempt to progress each time.</p>

<p>Test 3: Creativity test</p>
<img src="zacgitbot.github.io/creative.png" width="500">

<p>The results of these tests do not surprise me. I vaguely assumed the answers of these tests going into them. I feel as though I am confident in my own ability and have a good personal perception and understanding. The results also mean that I can see my strengths and weaknesses. I can now clearly better understand my learning abilities and what inhibits my learning. It was remarkably interesting to read these results, and I cannot say that I disagree with them. These tests are accurate to my nature and reflecting on all that I have just read I am able to broaden my perspective in multiple settings. </p>
<p>My understanding of these test will influence my behaviour in a team as I can clearly identify my strengths, weaknesses and learning abilities. Being a mediator, I know that I can be overly idealistic and difficult to get to know. Knowing these, I will make a conscious effort to better myself in a team environment such as trying to be more open and settle in better with my team. I know that I am a tactile learner and will take advantage of this to do the practical side of things in a team setting.  </p>
<p>Knowing the results of these tests, I feel as though I can be teamed with most people. Considering my results, I should attempt to form a team that would be beneficial for everyone and include a diverse personality range that can co-operate efficiently such as people who are outgoing and conflict free. Equality in a team is highly sought out by my personality type, so I will try to get a team where everyone is of equal skill and experience. </p>

<h1>Project idea</h1>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>My project is a free lifestyle fitness application. The application is a calorie tracker & fitness application that focuses on uncomplicating health tracking diets. The features available within the application are what make it stand out. These features include a completely customisable fitness plan, accurate and visual tracking goals, inspirational and motivational notifications, quotes & reminders, a rewards system and the potential to be integrated with other apps and hardware such as digital fitness scales. This application is designed to be as simple as possible, with the option to customise the app completely around an individual's life.  </p>
<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
<p>I have chosen to create this project as I am extremely passionate about fitness. There are a number of applications out there that can track calories, however after trying multiple I feel as though a lot of them are difficult and awkward to maneuverer with limited features. The project that I am creating is more of a lifestyle tool by simplifying data and aiding in habitual routine to promote this healthy lifestyle as studies have demonstrated that long-term lifestyle changes are the most beneficial and easiest to maintain as opposed to following a fad diet. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Obesity in adults is up by 10% since 1995 and as of 2017, 2 in 3 Australians are overweight.  </p>
<p><i><u><style="font-size: 10px;">Reference: https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-health/overweight-and-obesity </u></i></p>
<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>Completely customisable and minimalist design is the core of my application. The issue with other applications in the market is their complexity. Whilst accurate and in-depth, the user experience is unpleasant. Having to manually input data and fiddle with number ratios is a tedious task and it is not sustainable due to an unpleasant user experience. My application aims to simplify the process and promote a healthy diet routine. From simple sign-up options such as with social media the application is easy to use from the get-go. A quick input of data will use formulas to calculate recommended many calories to consume for weight loss or gain. The option to follow several recommended diets and meal plans catering to how many meals an individual would eat a day. There are also options to include personal recipes and store-bought meals. The idea behind this is that having the information pre-set, it would only take a click of a button to essentially check off the calories, this information is then displayed on the home screen where it shows how many calories has been consumed and how many are left to reach the goal. </p>
<p>The simple and minimalistic design is its core foundation, to be uncomplicated and to create the easiest methods for calorie tracking. This will be done through a number of strategies such as: Barcode scanning to gather meal data quickly, memory of previously consumed meals to easily enter data, recommended meals and serving sizes, smoother user interface design structure such as the use of buttons, check boxes or sliders to easily input data opposed to typing out data. All data will be broken down on the home screen where beautiful graphs will display the macro goals and how many macros are currently consumed. This can be opened further into a micro nutrient breakdown, meals eaten in a day and their values all listed in a graph, meal history, etc.</p>
<p>Another feature included in my application is inspiration and motivational features. As stated, the issue with many people is that they do not sustain their health journey. To promote a healthy routine and to motivate users there will be a number of motivational tips and encouragement from the application. These will be sent via notifications to remind users to keep working hard, that they’ve met the goal for the day and should feel proud, etc. Banners and encouragement in the app such as featured stories, quotes, tips for dieting, a fitness journey that shows progress, music recommendations & playlists and many more. Long term commitment is where change is seen. </p>
<p>This app is designed to combine and replace the need for multiple applications. This is done through the integration of secondary applications and external devices. The idea that once you step on your smart scale in the morning all your information is automatically placed into this one app so that it can integrate with your fitness journey and easily track progress. To use a smartwatch such as a FitBit or Apple iWatch and have data such as heart rate, steps taken, physical activity done in a day is crucial information as it allows for accurate calculations of calories used and how many calories are needed to consume. The uniformity of having one application to track all data promotes this lifestyle change. </p>
<p>Another feature included within this application is a social media aspect. The option to share your fitness journey and communicate with other app users around you & friends is unique to this calorie tracker. This feature is designed to promote a community of people attempting to better their lives. This adds another layer of depth the application that makes it stand out, to be able to communicate with friends and search profiles of one another to make it unique as opposed to a boring tracker. </p>
<p><b>Tools and technologies</b></p>
To make this application for both android and iOS I will be using a cross platform program such as Xamarin in Visual Studio. I need a phone for testing purposes and my laptop to write code on. I will be using graphic design programs such as Adobe Photoshop to make the graphics required for my simple design. Future hardware integration will require smartscales, smartwatches and more. Some open source tools that I will potentially be using are GitHub and open source code that enable me to use the ‘smartability’ feature implementation.  Additionally I will be using WYSIWYG tools in order to plan and develop the UI.</p>
<p><b>Skills required</b></p>
<p>Programming skills in mobile development are required for this project. I have chosen to do this using Xamarin as I am familiar with the C# programming language. Database management and creation skills will be necessary. Additional skills required will be graphic design as needed to create the graphics and plan the best possible user interface. Being skilled with Photoshop is required as it will be used to create the graphics. Mathematical skills will be needed as there will be many formulas and maths involved in this application. The skills required of this project are not unreasonably obtainable. The bulk of this application is feasible, however, I believe some of the more sophisticated features of the program aren’t as feasible such as hardware integration & other app sharing data, for example, the fitness scale. </p>
<p>To accomplish this project, I will first be planning storyboards, researching the best ways to integrate and plan my designs for different coding aspects and educate myself with new languages that I might need to learn. I will be designing the UI and prototyping the interfaces with tools such as WYSIWYG. My approach to software development is by prototyping and so I will be making prototypes of this project and build upon them. I will use GitHub to document my progress and build upon my prototypes. </p>
<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
<p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be the best macro tracking application on the market. The need for multiple applications will be redundant. The simplicity of this application will aid users in making healthy lifestyle changes. The original will not be solved, however having the tool freely available will make it a necessary tool in the fight for the prevalence against obesity in the world. The impact that this development could have on user's lives could be life changing. After creating this application I will also have educated myself extensively and gathered valuable knowledge and training to add to my portfolio for future jobs potentially. </p>
